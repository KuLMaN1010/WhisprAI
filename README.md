Whispr.AI – Real‑Time Agent Coach
🏅 Hackathon Result: 2nd Place – IBM “Advance the Future of Customer Experience” (May 2025)



Live Demo: (if deployed)

🧠 Overview

Whispr.AI is a React‑powered customer support coaching tool that provides real‑time, AI‑driven guidance to support agents/reps. As a customer chats, Whispr.AI analyzes tone, emotion, 
and context—then surfaces concise coaching cues to help agents respond with empathy, clarity, and confidence.

This is a project built for hackathon and rapid prototyping, Whispr.AI demonstrates how retrieval‑augmented generation and custom prompting can elevate human interactions in customer service to improve/ advance the future of customer experience

✨ Features

Live Chat Interface: Two‑panel layout with customer messages on the right and coaching suggestions on the left.

Emotion & Tone Detection: Leverages a backend AI service to extract emotion, trigger, mindset, and tone from customer messages.

Dynamic Coaching Cues: Presents actionable advice and suggested phrasing to guide agent replies.

Dual Modes: Toggle between Customer and Agent modes to simulate both sides of the conversation flow (just for the sake of hackathon time constraints, can be updated later)

Responsive UI: Tailwind CSS layout inspired by leading chat apps for a familiar, clean experience.


🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, lucide‑react icons

Backend: Python Flask (or FastAPI) for RAG‑powered coaching API

AI: IBM watsonx.ai with custom prompt templates
